  # List

* A list in Python is an orderd sequence of elements. 
  
* Elements in a list are called items
  
* It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.)
  
* A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.
  
* List in Python is mutable. 
  
* Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having items(/elements/values) between square brackets [ ] separated by commas ','
